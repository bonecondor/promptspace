# Prompt for Claude

I'm building PromptSpace, a StumbleUpon-style discovery site for AI prompts styled like 2007 MySpace profiles. I've attached a creative brief explaining the current state and the problem.

The core issue: my topic seeds and generation prompts are producing content that feels **anxious and samey** - too much existential dread, melancholy, loneliness. I want the vibe of stumbling onto something delightful and unexpected on the old internet.

Help me brainstorm:

1. **New topic categories** we're missing entirely (I have 15 categories, 120 topics currently)

2. **Specific topic ideas** that hit the "wait, that's a thing?" vibe with JOY rather than dread. Think:
   - Competitive duck herding
   - Someone's passionate shrine to a discontinued cereal
   - Surprisingly thorough history of the color beige
   - Niche hobby drama that's fascinating not depressing

3. **Tone adjustments** for the generation prompt. Currently it says "weird, specific, slightly unhinged, lowercase energy" - what language would get more warmth, curiosity, and playfulness without losing the specificity?

4. **The charmingly obsessive vs sad line** - what makes the difference? How do we stay on the right side?

Let's make this feel like the best parts of old StumbleUpon, not a therapy session. Give me specific, actionable ideas I can implement.
